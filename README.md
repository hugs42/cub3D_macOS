# cub3d - 42

## About

This project is inspired by the world-famous 90’s game Wolfenstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever.
The goal of this project is to create a 3d like rendering by implementing a simple raycaster using the minilibx library.

It will enable to explore ray-casting. The goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.
